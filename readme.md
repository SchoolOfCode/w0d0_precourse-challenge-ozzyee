# My Tribute Site is about Tim Bergling aka Avicii

I chose to make a site about Tim Bergling as im a big fan of his music and I look up to him as a DJ.
I like his music as all of his music has a nice rhythm to it and makes it really fun to Dj with.

I found the development of this site really fun to make i learnt how to position div's with display flex,
this was really helpful to center div's with very minimal styling. I also made this site mobile responsive with @media attribute.
i made this site mobile first witch I believe is the right way to do websites.


thank you for reading.
