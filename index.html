               <p class="paragraph-text">
                  Tim Bergling, born in the Swedish capital of Stockholm in
                  1989, was a world famous DJ playing under the stage name
                  ‘Avicii’. Having been passionate about music since he was as
                  young as eight-years-old, Bergling began making music at 16
                  and releasing it online. He was soon noticed and signed to a
                  record label, Dejfitts Plays, in 2007. His first major song
                  track release came with Seek Bromance in 2010, with the hit
                  track reaching top 40s in European countries and topping dance
                  music charts. Avicii went on to achieve greater chart
                  successes the following year with the release of EDM track,
                  Levels. Levels soared to top 10 chart spots across Europe and
                  helped to establish Bergling’s presence in the industry, with
                  the star then signing to larger record label EMI Music
                  Publishing and receiving a Grammy nomination for the track.
                  Bergling went on to collaborate with major music sensations
                  such as Madonna, co-writing and co-producing several tracks on
                  her 2015 album, Rebel Heart, as well as Coldplay’s Chris
                  Martin and DJ David Guetta
